# IMF DataDive: Gender Repository
## Repository Description

### Introduction
Gender equality plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainable economic growth. Recognizing this, entities like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are amplifying their efforts to integrate gender perspectives into economic policy considerations. One significant barrier is the lack of detailed gender-disaggregated data, which is crucial for understanding various aspects such as women's participation in the economy, unpaid labor, consumption patterns, and much more.

In partnership with DataKind, the DataDive project is a strategic initiative targeting the creation of a consolidated Global Gender Economic Data Repository.

### Expected Outcomes
Post the DataDive, our ambition is to unveil a harmonized gender-disaggregated consumption dataset in Excel format, encapsulating data from a minimum of five countries. This data is poised to be instrumental in simulating gender-specific repercussions of policy alterations. Furthermore, methodologies and strategies carved out during the DataDive can be leveraged for future data extraction and harmonization tasks, especially for surveys conducted across other countries.
